  * Learning Financial Accounting can often feel like learning a foreign language to students, in particular when terminology and procedure is piled on before core concepts are truly mastered. Introductory Financial Accounting for Business is an innovative approach that emphasizes critical thinking over the rote memorization of terms, such as “debits” and “credits”. The sequential learning model employed by the authors helps students see the bottom-line consequences of financial statements as it relates to the overall business, better preparing them for careers as accountants, entrepreneurs, and decision-makers.
